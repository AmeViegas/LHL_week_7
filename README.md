Week 7: Node
============

## GitHub training: Learn you some node


## Betting on Node (CR) - requirements

    Create your js file (game.js) and paste in your JS code/solution from that assignment. The only changes you will 
    have to make to the game.js file are minor:
    
    Install and require a module to support the synchronous prompt function to ask the user for input. The prompt 
    function which returns the userâ€™s input is not supported by default. The source code and README for the sync-prompt 
    module can be found here: https://www.npmjs.com/package/prompt-sync
    Convert your alert statements into console.log statements, since node outputs to stdout using console.log and not 
    alert. Alerts are not supported since there is no browser GUI.
    You should be able to run your js file using the node command.
